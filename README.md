# Prid'x

A light and simple CSS stylesheet to help you start any responsive web design project. Basically a fluid flex based responsive CSS grid.

## Usage

Build your grids with `.row` and `.col-x` elements. For example:

```html
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-12"></div>
	<div class="col-6"></div>
	<div class="col-6"></div>
	...
</div>	
```
